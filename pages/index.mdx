# Introduction
 
Welcome to the Blockbud. Blockbud is a web 3D renderer uses GLB extension models, if you don't have any GLB extension models: make sure to export from Blender as GLB.

### Good Things to Keep In Mind
* While exporting from Mineways, make sure to check box "Export individual textures to [tex]"
* If you are using Blender plugin which makes your work a lot of easier, keep in mind that plugin works specially for Blender. Blockbud might not support it.
* Make sure you adjusted your textures reflections & other things. Textures will react according to lighting, if something is odd, follow the tutorials on YouTube.
